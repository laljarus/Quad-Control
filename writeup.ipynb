    "# Control of a 3D Quadcopter\n",

    "The aim of this project is to develop a controller for a 3D quadcopter. The [starter Code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls-CPP) of the project and the project [rubics](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1643/view) are given in the links. This writeup of the project explains how each point in the project rubic is addressed in the project.\n",

    "\n",
    "A quadcopter is an under-actuated system. It has 6 degrees of freedom (3 - translation and 3 - rotations) but it has only 4 acutuators (rotors). Another challenge for controlling a quadcopter is the coupling of motions i.e. one degree of freedom depends on state of another degree of freedom. For example the following equations govern the motion of a quadcopter in 2D plane.\n",
